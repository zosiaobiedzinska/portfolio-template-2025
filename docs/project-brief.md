## Project Concept

### What are you building?

I’m building a portfolio template that I will later use as my personal website — a showcase for clients and a representation of who I am online.

### Who is it for?

The website is intended for my future clients as well as for people who want to get to know me from an artistic perspective and those who appreciate art.

### Why does it matter?

This matters because it’s my calling card — something that allows the person on the other side of the screen to get to know me.
